This program attempts to evaluate whether two files of code were written by the same person. It gets user input of two files and the language they were written in and returns the probability the second was plagiarized from the first.

A list of the files:

main.cs runs the program

wordfreq.cs compares the frequency of words. 

spacing.cs compares the spacing distribution.

expressions.cs and keywords.cs compares how often the programmer uses for versus while loops.

variables.cs compares the variable names.

functions.cs finds and compares the function names.

comments.cs analyzes the location and contents of comments.

testfiles has files to test this code on.
